# The Great La Palma bioacoustic bird challenge!
By Alastair Pickering

This notebook was written for the NERC London DTP field trip to La Palma March 2024 and is designed to demonstrate how to use AI tools to automatically process acoustic data. It forms part of the bird challenge practical in which groups of students set up AudioMoths based on field guide recommended practice with a view to trying to obtain the highest number of species detections.

The notebook uses the BirdNET algorithm developed by Cornell University and adds an analysis wrapper to demonstrate single species and multi-species classifications using different confidence thresholds. Functions for spectrogram comparison and audio playback are added to enable ground truthing of results.

A link to a set of example audio files is provided with a view to this being replaced by the students' own recordings.
